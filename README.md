# Project Info
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using Java Swing, a GUI library in Java. It provides an interactive and visually appealing environment where the player controls a snake that moves around a game board, aiming to eat food and grow longer. The game challenges the player to avoid collisions with the snake's own body, making it progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer.after collision the game will be over then press space to restart.
# How to run
To run the Snake Game project, follow these steps:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you haven't already.
Set up your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans).
Create a new Java project in your IDE and configure the project settings.
Import the necessary Java Swing libraries into your project.
Create the required classes for the game, including the main class, game board class, snake class, and food class.
Implement the logic for the game mechanics, such as snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
Design and implement the graphical user interface using Java Swing components, including the game board and the snake.
Compile the project to ensure there are no errors in the code.
Run the compiled project, and a game window will open, displaying the game board and the snake.
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement and guide it towards the food items.
When the snake eats a food item, it grows longer, and the player earns points.
Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the walls of the game board.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls. The player's score is displayed.
The player can choose to play again or exit the game.
By following these steps, you can create and run a Snake Game project using Java Swing, providing an enjoyable gaming
